# TFPtoCO2_paper

This repository includes R scripts to replicate analysis in “Reduced benefits of climate-smart agricultural policies from land use spillovers” by David Lobell and Nelson Villoria

The main files are those that create figures in paper, which are titled based on the figure. All scripts depend on functions and data included in the TFPtoCO2 R package.

We also include clean_v2 (which processes data on GHG emissions) and do_v2 (which includes exploratory analysis and generates the 1998-2017 average emissions factors for each country).

# TFPtoCO2_paper

This repository includes R scripts to replicate analysis in “Reduced benefits of climate-smart agricultural policies from land use spillovers” by David Lobell and Nelson Villoria

The main files are those that create figures in paper, which are titled based on the figure. All scripts depend on functions and data included in the TFPtoCO2 R package.

We also include a script that preprocesses data on GHG emissions and generates the 1998-2017 average emissions factors for each country.
